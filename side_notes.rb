# Just notes, comments and copied pasted stuff.....

# parser file goes here, which builds the deck object(?)


#Example parsing method from csv to new data structure full of objects (tasks into list):
  # def populate_task_list_from_csv(file)
  #     csv_file = CSV.open(file).map do |row|
  #       self.list << Task.new(row[0])
  #     end
  #   end

# I'm going to grab the .txt data and put it into a csv format in flashcard.csv:
#   line 1: alias, To create a second name for the variable or method.
#   line 2: and, A command that appends two or more objects together.
#   etc....   DONE***

# This method will probably just go into deck, but Eddy and Carolina are working on tha
